#  AdventureWorks Manufacturing & Inventory Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project presents an **end-to-end data analysis and visualization** of the manufacturing and inventory operations of **Adventure Works**, a fictional multinational bicycle manufacturing company.  
The analysis integrates data from **SQL Server**, **Python**, and **Power BI**, providing deep insights into production efficiency, category-level trends, and inventory management.

The core objective is to:
- Analyze production and inventory performance over multiple fiscal years.
- Identify bottlenecks and wastage in the production pipeline.
- Evaluate product-level turnover, cost efficiency, and stock management.
- Deliver actionable insights through interactive Power BI dashboards.

##  Data Model Overview
A custom **star schema** data model was created to improve data refresh performance and analytical flexibility.  

**Tables used in this project:**
| Table | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| `Production.Product` | Contains details of each product including cost, weight, and category. |
| `Production.ProductInventory` | Tracks product-level inventory quantities and locations. |
| `Production.ProductCategory` | Defines the product category (e.g., Bikes, Components, Clothing). |
| `Production.ProductSubcategory` | Defines subcategories under each category. |
| `Production.WorkOrder` | Contains production transactions and work order data. |
| `Production.WorkOrderRouting` | Defines the routing and scheduling of each work order. |
| `Sales.SalesOrderDetail` | Records individual item-level sales transactions. |
| `Production.ScrapReason` | Holds data on manufacturing waste and scrap causes. |
| `Calendar` | A custom date table created in Power BI using DAX for fiscal calculations. |

## Key Insights
-Inventory Efficiency â€“ $74.28bn tied up in 336K units; turnover ratio (~2.0â€“3.5) shows moderate stock movement but hints at overproduction in some periods.

-Production Mix â€“ Road Bikes (52%) dominate output, while Wheels and Derailleurs emerge as critical cost and demand drivers.

-Operational Gaps â€“ Long lead times (~297 days) and only 41.6% on-time order completion highlight major efficiency bottlenecks.

-Waste & Quality â€“ Waste is minimal (0.24%), but recurring defects signal process-level quality issues.

-Cost Drivers â€“ Final Assembly and Frame Forming processes account for the largest costs, requiring optimization.

-Trends â€“ Production peaked in FY 2012â€“13, then stabilized; efficiency fluctuates year-over-year, pointing to inconsistent process control.
